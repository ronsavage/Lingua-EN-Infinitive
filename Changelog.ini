[V 1.09]
Date=2005-10-27T19:40:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Regenerate META.yml with Module::Build V 0.2611 to correct a faulty
META.yml output by V 0.24 which falsely said 'provides: {}',
which in turn stopped the PAUSE indexer from finding the module file,
which in turn meant this module might be omitted from the master index:
ftp://pause.perl.org/pub/PAUSE/modules/01modules.index.html
EOT

[V 1.08]
Date=2004-07-20T20:43:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Change Makefile.PL to coexist with Module::Build
- Add t/pod.t to test all PODs
EOT

[V 1.07]
Date=2003-03-23T11:29:00
Comments= <<EOT
- No source code changes in this version
- Patch to stop shipping blib/ directory in Unix distros, because the
PAUSE indexer takes this directory to indicate a binary distro,
which means it does not index the module, and this in turn means
the module is not listed in the CPAN daily update list, etc.

Date=2002-05-28T18:45:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Add special code to Infinitive.pm when the suffix is 'ed'.
Check for a monosyllable ending in a doubled-consonant.
This code is identical to the special code for rule 15
- Add some more irregular verbs to the list and test for them

[V 1.04]
Date=2001-06-19T00:00:00
Comments= <<EOT
----------------
o Patch outcome of rule 15 so certain monosyllables are treated specially.
Eg swimming => swim and swimm, not swimme and swimm.
Thanks to Mike Tsai for drawing this problem to my attention.
Previous testing had completely overlooked these types of words.
o Researching this problem reveals that, unfortunately, American spelling
such as traveling => travel is handled correctly but British spelling
such as travelling => travel is not.
